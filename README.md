Generates a covering array based on the input parameters.
Greedy_Array.py and Randomized_Multi_Level_Array.py work the same way:
$python3 Greedy_Array.py  3  2,2,2,2,2,2
1. Call the file using the Python interpreter
2. First argument is the number of interactions you want your covering array to have
3. Second argument is the array with the levels for each column
    Will be sorted in code from lowest to highest automatically.
